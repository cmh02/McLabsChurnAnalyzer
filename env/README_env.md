# MCLabs Churn Analyzer: Environmental Variables

Our project does include some environmental variables that need to be configured. Within our project structure, we have created a `.env` file that resides inside this directory. The template of this `.env` file can be seen in [.env.example](.env.example), where all keys are defined to some placeholder value.
