# MCLabs Churn Analyzer

Welcome to the [MCLabs](https://labs-mc.com/) (often shortened to MCL) Churn Analyzer!

This tool will implement a machine learning model to predict the churn of players based on player metrics. Initially, we will use a simple logistic regression model, but may move to a more advanced model at a later point in time.
